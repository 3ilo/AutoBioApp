# Development Log

## 2025-01-27: Enhanced Image Generation Feature - Frontend Integration Complete
- **Feature**: Frontend integration of enhanced AI image generation with user context
- **Implementation**: Updated client to support enhanced profile fields and image generation
- **Components**: Enhanced Profile page with extended fields, updated Contribute page with user context
- **API Integration**: Updated API service to include user ID in image generation requests
- **User Experience**: Comprehensive profile management with privacy controls
- **Status**: Frontend integration complete, ready for end-to-end testing
- **Next Step**: Test complete user flow from profile setup to enhanced image generation

## 2025-01-27: Enhanced Image Generation Feature - Optimized Implementation Complete
- **Feature**: Enhanced AI image generation with user context and memory summarization
- **Optimization**: Individual memory summaries stored with each memory
- **Implementation**: Memory summary service, updated data models, and fallback logic
- **Benefits**: Reduced context size, persistent storage, better performance
- **Services**: BedrockMemorySummaryService, updated SummarizationService
- **Data Models**: Memory model enhanced with summary field
- **API**: Memory creation/update generates summaries, image generation uses pre-generated summaries
- **Status**: Implementation complete with optimized approach
- **Next Step**: Run integration tests and deploy with feature flags

## 2025-01-27: Enhanced Image Generation Feature - Implementation Complete
- **Feature**: Enhanced AI image generation with user context and memory summarization
- **Implementation**: Core services, data models, and controllers updated
- **Services**: BedrockSummarizationService and PromptEnhancementService implemented
- **Data Models**: User model enhanced with new profile fields
- **API**: Existing image generation endpoint enhanced with user context
- **Status**: Implementation complete, ready for testing
- **Next Step**: Run integration tests and deploy with feature flags

## 2025-01-27: Enhanced Image Generation Feature - TDD Implementation
- **Feature**: Enhanced AI image generation with user context and memory summarization
- **Problem**: Current image generation only uses date, title, and memory content, leading to inaccurate images
- **Solution**: Implement comprehensive prompt enhancement with user metadata and memory summaries
- **Approach**: Test-Driven Development (TDD) with 3-step process
- **Status**: Unit tests completed, ready for implementation
- **Next Step**: Implement services and controllers for enhanced image generation
